-- DRUG_ERA (derived)

/*
Drug Eras
If the DRUG_EXPOSURE table is populated this script will string together periods of time
that a person is exposed to an active drug ingredient, allowing for 30 gaps in between.
It will then insert the resulting era records into the DRUG_ERA table.
NOTE This query only works with the version 5 series and below.
