models:
  - name: CONDITION_OCCURRENCE
    description: The CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table contains Events where Persons engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time.
    columns:
      - name: CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID
        description: The unique key given to a condition record for a person. Refer to the ETL for how duplicate conditions during the same visit were handled; Each instance of a condition present in the source data should be assigned this unique key. In some cases, a person can have multiple records of the same condition within the same visit. It is valid to keep these duplicates and assign them individual, unique, CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_IDs, though it is up to the ETL how they should be handled.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: PERSON_ID
        description: The PERSON_ID of the PERSON for whom the condition is recorded.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('PERSON_RAW')
              field: PERSON_ID

      - name: CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID
        description: The CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source value which represents a condition; The CONCEPT_ID that the CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. Only records whose source values map to concepts with a domain of “Condition” should go in this table.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: source('OMOP','CONCEPT')
              field: CONCEPT_ID

      - name: condition_start_date
        description: Use this date to determine the start date of the condition; Most often data sources do not have the idea of a start date for a condition. Rather, if a source only has one date associated with a condition record it is acceptable to use that date for both the CONDITION_START_DATE and the CONDITION_END_DATE.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: condition_start_datetime
        description: If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000)

      - name: condition_end_date
        description: Use this date to determine the end date of the condition; Most often data sources do not have the idea of a start date for a condition. Rather, if a source only has one date associated with a condition record it is acceptable to use that date for both the CONDITION_START_DATE and the CONDITION_END_DATE.

      - name: condition_end_datetime
        description: If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000)

      - name: CONDITION_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID
        description: This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Condition record, as in whether the condition was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources; Choose the CONDITION_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID that best represents the provenance of the record.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: source('OMOP','CONCEPT')
              field: CONCEPT_ID

      - name: CONDITION_STATUS_CONCEPT_ID
        description: Not Applicable - Value:0 (This concept represents the point during the visit the diagnosis was given (admitting diagnosis, final diagnosis), whether the diagnosis was determined due to laboratory findings, if the diagnosis was exclusionary, or if it was a preliminary diagnosis, among others;	Choose the Concept in the Condition Status domain that best represents the point during the visit when the diagnosis was given. These can include admitting diagnosis, principal diagnosis, and secondary diagnosis.)
        # tests:
        #   - relationships:
        #       to: source('OMOP','CONCEPT')
        #       field: CONCEPT_ID

      - name: stop_reason
        description: The Stop Reason indicates why a Condition is no longer valid with respect to the purpose within the source data. Note that a Stop Reason does not necessarily imply that the condition is no longer occurring; This information is often not populated in source data and it is a valid etl choice to leave it blank if the information does not exist.

      - name: PROVIDER_ID
        description: The provider associated with condition record, e.g. the provider who made the diagnosis or the provider who recorded the symptom; The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record, for example the admitting vs attending physician on an EHR record.
        tests:
          # - not_null:
          #     config:
          #       severity: warn
          - relationships:
              to: ref('PROVIDER_RAW')
              field: PROVIDER_ID

      - name: VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID
        description: The visit during which the condition occurred; Depending on the structure of the source data, this may have to be determined based on dates. If a CONDITION_START_DATE occurs within the start and end date of a Visit it is a valid ETL choice to choose the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID from the Visit that subsumes it, even if not explicitly stated in the data. While not required, an attempt should be made to locate the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID of the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE record.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:
                severity: warn
          - relationships:
              to: ref('VISIT_OCCURRENCE')
              field: VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID

      - name: VISIT_DETAIL_ID
        description: The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the condition occurred. For example, if the person was in the ICU at the time of the diagnosis the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit; Same rules apply as for the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID.
        # tests:
        #   - not_null:
        #       config:
        #         severity: warn
        # - relationships:
        #     to: ref('VISIT_DETAIL')
        #     field: VISIT_DETAIL_ID

      - name: condition_source_value
        description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition that occurred. For example, this could be an ICD10 or Read code; This code is mapped to a Standard Condition Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference.

      - name: CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID
        description: This is the concept representing the condition source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Condition necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network; If the CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here.
        # tests:
        #   - relationships:
        #       to: source('OMOP','CONCEPT')
        #       field: CONCEPT_ID

      - name: condition_status_source_value
        description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition status; This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating when and how a diagnosis was given to a patient. This source value is mapped to a standard concept which is stored in the CONDITION_STATUS_CONCEPT_ID field.
